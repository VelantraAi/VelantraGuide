For example, if the account has a buy position, then a user cannot open a sell position or place a pending sell order. Ther rule is only applied to acounts with hedging accounting system.<p><b><i>Email Response</i></b></p><p>Hi (client),</p>
<p>The error you’re seeing — “opposite positions on a single symbol are disabled” — is happening because your R-S15 FIFO account is with a US-based broker (Forex.com).</p>
<p>Here’s what it means in simple terms:</p>
  <p>• Your account cannot hold both a buy and a sell position on the same symbol at the same time.</p>
  <p>• For example, if there’s an open buy on EURGBP, the system cannot open a sell position until that buy is closed.</p>
  <p>• Pending orders in the opposite direction are also blocked until existing positions are closed.</p>
  <p>• This is a regulatory requirement for US brokers and cannot be overridden by the system.</p>
<p>Because of this rule, the Social Trader Tool (STT) will re-attempt the command every minute, but it will only execute once the existing position is closed or reversed.</p>">
        Error Code 10046
      </li>

      <li class="list-item" data-description="The trade didn’t open because the broker couldn’t provide a valid price at the exact moment the order was sent (Error 136: Off Quotes). This usually happens during fast market movement or low liquidity. The system will keep retrying every second, and the trade will only execute once a stable quote is available; otherwise, it may be skipped. This is not an issue with your account or the copier connection.<p><b><i>Email Response</i></b></p><p>The system successfully sent the order, however it was rejected by the broker due to Error Code 136 (Off Quotes). This means that at the moment the trade was placed, the broker could not provide a valid executable price—typically caused by rapid price movement, spread changes, or temporary liquidity conditions.</p>
<p>What to expect:</p>
<p>• The system will automatically retry the trade once every second.</p>
<p>• The trade will execute as soon as a valid quote becomes available and market conditions stabilize.</p>
<p>• If the broker continues rejecting quotes due to volatility, the trade may be skipped for that specific entry.</p>
<p>Please note this does not indicate an issue with your account or the copier connection, and no funds were lost from this particular trade attempt.</p>
<p>If you’d like, we can also review your execution settings (such as slippage tolerance and risk parameters) to reduce the likelihood of this occurring during high-volatility periods.</p>">
